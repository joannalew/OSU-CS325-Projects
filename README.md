4/20 (Joanna) : Hey Nathan, I finally figured out what you meant by the recursive solution having trouble returning the proper indices. 
Got it working! It's kinda messy, but using your Result struct, I basically "set" the indices every time I "set" the sum. I think it
could be improved if the "==" was overloaded.

I also used yours and Daniel's code to finish up the algorithms. They all take in a vector and return a struct Result. The code
is in algosJ.cpp
