4/20 (Joanna) : Hey guys, I got all four algorithms working using the code we shared earlier. They all take in a vector and return a Result (the struct Nathan made). Also, I made a class for reading/writing files, so we don't need to deal with memory leaks. I separated out the main and functions, so it's a bit cleaner. 

functions.cpp - has all 4 algorithms + file class

main.cpp - testing algorithms + how to use file class
